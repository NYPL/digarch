# Introduction
When Digital Preservation staff do not participate in site visits all acquired born-digital material should be shipped to the lab through the registrar. Digital Preservation staff present at site visits may determine another method of transfer. 

## Site Visits
While on a site visit Digital Preservation staff can evaluation born-digital material. When necessary, Digital Preservation staff can arrange a method of transfer different from the standard process of shipment through the registrar.

### Considerations
Method of transfer will depend on:
* Volume of born-digital material
* Transfer time
* Uniqueness of files
* Active use of equipment

### Site Visit File Transfers
Once evaluated, born-digital material can be scheduled for transfer at a subsequent site visit. Born-digital material might be transferred during a site visit rather than shipped through the registrar if files on the donor's active computer are in the collection scope. Site visit transfer is an option when it is not feasible for the donor to transfer active files to an external hard drive.

<!-- The following section is meant to acknowledge that Digital Preservation staff's current interaction with donors is geared towards individuals rather than organizations. Procedures should be evaluated to leverage resources those organizations may have when arranging transfer. -->
### Organizations

Born-digital material from organizations differs in a number of ways from born-digital material donated by an individual. Make certain you are in contact with someone that manages or maintains born-digital material for the organization during this process.

#### Records management

Ask about any records management procedures the organization takes part in.

#### Organizations with IT
Be aware of any IT department or technology services the organization uses. Evaluate whether these services can be used in the transfer of born-digital material.
