# Accessioning  
Accessioning consists of taking legal, administrative, and physical custody of digital material to be transferred to the lab. Accessioning born-digital material includes verifying that the acquisition has been properly documented, validating the materialâ€™s completeness and fixity, and then creating an object record in SPEC to support collection management and project planning.  

Accessioning of digital material is usually done by Collection Management.  

Processing archivists create SPEC object records for additional carriers found during processing.
