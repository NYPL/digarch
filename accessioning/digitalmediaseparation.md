# Introduction

When digital media is encountered during the processing of archival collections it is separated from folders and prepared for transfer. 

|When commercial software is present do not enter it in CMS or label it. Send commercial software as is to Digital Preservation.|

Digital media separation procedures are detailed in this document. The workflows may vary based on media types  encountered but the general steps are as follows:  

1. Open the collection record in CMS.  
2. Determine the identification number.  
3. Label media.
4. Create a media log record.  
5. Fill out a digital media separation form.  
6. Create a shelving card and shelve the media.  

## 1. Open the collection record in CMS.

* Open CMS and locate the collection that you will be working with. Navigate to the electronic records view through the collection management screen.  

## 2. Determine the identification number.

Create an identification number for a digital media object using
4 elements:

* A letter (M for manuscript is used for most collections processed by
AU, L for NYPL internal institutional archives)  
```M```  

* The collection number from CMS  
```1087```  

* A dash  
```-```  

* A sequential number of the object padded to 4 digits  
```0001```  

    * When there are no media objects in the
collection log the sequential number will be 0001. Objects already recorded in the log will be listed in
the right hand column. The sequential number will be the next number
that hasn't been allocated.  For example, the
tenth object in manuscript collection ```1087``` would be labeled:
```M1087-0010```.  

The id numbers Digital Preservation uses are only for differentiating one disk from another. Sequence is only relevant for counting a number of disks. This method of id may be deprecated.

## 3. Label media.

* For floppy and zip disks, print the number in ink on a new
label and affixed it to the media. Labeling media with a P-Touch is best.

* For Optical media (CDs, DVDs), print the number
on the media's plastic hub using a using a medium point Sharpie pen. House CDs or DVDs in a sleeve or case if they are not housed. Rehouse CDs or DVDs that are sleeved/cased together into individual sleeves or cases, unless the case is designed for multiple CDs or DVDs.  

* Make sure no label adhesive sticks to moving parts of the media. Many media types have shutters, gates, or spools that need to move freely to work. Covering a shutter or other moving part with a label can damage the disk and the drive used to read media.  

* Check in with Digital Preservation staff to discuss labeling other media types.  

|Digital Preservation staff can label commercial software with a simple collection name.
```Crouch``` for Stanley Crouch papers.|

## 4. Create a media log record.  

 Enter the following
information in the media log page for the collection.

* id

    * Enter the identification number for the media.

* media format

    * Enter or select the appropriate media type (for example: 5.25 inch floppy disk,
3.5 inch floppy disk, CD-R, DVD-R, zip disk, hard drive, flash drive).  

    * See [Identifying Digital Media](../sitevisits/identifying-digital-media){:target="_blank"} for media types.   

* floppy density

    * Select the appropriate floppy disk density from the drop down if available. Leave blank for other media types.  

* manufacturer

    * Enter manufacturer of the media if known. 

* serial number (hd)

    * Enter the serial number if the media object is a hard disk drive. Leave blank for other media types.  

| Label transcript is an optional field. If you want to transcript a label you can enter text as it appears on the label. You can enter ```[illegible]``` for words you can't decipher.|

## 5. Fill out a digital media separation form.  
Deprecated
{: .label .label-red }
* Fill out a
[media separation form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tn9j4q3WO5BhhMdXY0Ed09XoRFP_jUJyP96IYCJmkgs/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} to document where in the collection a media object came from. 

* Enter the object's identification number and collection. Circle the
format on the form. Enter the correct
format after the word Other if the format is not listed. Print the form on BLUE
paper (for visibility) and place it in the object's previous container.

## 6. Shelve the media.

* Place the separated media on the shelf labeled 'INCOMING MEDIA' outside
the Manager of Archival Processing's office.  
* Place media you can carry without a box in the small collections box on the Incoming Media shelf.  
* Places larger collections of media in boxes and place the boxes on the Incoming Media shelf.  
* File the media by collection number and each media item sequentially.  
* Place floppy and zip disks with the read/write access shutter facing up.
