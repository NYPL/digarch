# Introduction

When digital media is encountered during the processing of archival collections it is separated from folders and prepared for transfer.  

Digital media separation procedures are detailed in this document. The workflows may vary based on media types  encountered but the general steps are as follows:  

1. Open the collection record in CMS.  
2. Determine the identification number.  
3. Label media.
4. Create a media log record.  
5. Fill out a digital media separation form.  
6. Create a shelving card and shelve the media.  

## 1. Open the collection record in CMS.

* Open CMS and locate the collection that you will be working with. Navigate to the electronic records view through the collection management screen.  

## 2. Determine the identification number.

Create an identification number for a digital media object using
4 elements:

* A letter (M for manuscript is used for most collections processed by
AU, L for NYPL internal institutional archives)  
```M```  

* The collection number from CMS  
```1087```  

* A dash  
```-```  

* A sequential number of the object padded to 4 digits  
```0001```  

    * When there are no media objects in the
collection log the sequential number will be 0001. Objects already recorded in the log will be listed in
the right hand column. The sequential number will be the next number
that hasn't been allocated.  For example, the
tenth object in manuscript collection ```1087``` would be labeled:
```M1087-0010```.  

## 3. Label media.

* For floppy and zip disks, print the number in ink on a new
label and affixed it to the media. Labeling media with a P-Touch is best.

* For Optical media (CDs, DVDs), print the number
on the media's plastic hub using a using a medium point Sharpie pen. House CDs or DVDs in a sleeve or case if they are not housed. Rehouse CDs or DVDs that are sleeved/cased together into individual sleeves or cases, unless the case is designed for multiple CDs or DVDs.  

* Contact the Digital Archives Assistant to discuss labeling other media types.

## 4. Create a media log record.  

 Enter the following
information in the media log page for the collection.

* id

    * Enter the identification number for the media.

* media format

    * Enter or select the appropriate media type (for example: 5.25 inch floppy disk,
3.5 inch floppy disk, CD-R, DVD-R, zip disk, hard drive, flash drive).  

* floppy density

    * Select the appropriate floppy disk density from the drop down if available. Leave blank for other media types.  

* manufacturer

    * Enter manufacturer of the media if known. 

* serial number (hd)

    * Enter the serial number if the media object is a hard disk drive. Leave blank for other media types.

## 5. Fill out a digital media separation form.  

* Fill out a
[media separation form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tn9j4q3WO5BhhMdXY0Ed09XoRFP_jUJyP96IYCJmkgs/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} to document where in the collection a media object came from. 

* Enter the object's identification number and collection. Circle the
format on the form. Enter the correct
format after the word Other if the format is not listed. Print the form on BLUE
paper (for visibility) and place it in the object's previous container.

## 6. Create a shelving card and shelve the media.

* Place the separated media on the shelf labeled 'INCOMING MEDIA' outside
the MAP's office. The label should contain the collection type (M or L),
the collection number and the
collection title. For example 'M2654 V Russo' for media from the
Vito Russo papers.

* File the media by collection number and each media item sequentially.
Floppy and zip disks lacking cases should be filed with the read/write
access shutter facing up.
