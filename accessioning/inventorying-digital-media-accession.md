# Introduction

When digital media is encountered during accessioning of archival collections separate boxes of media are prepared for transfer by Collection Management.  

When digital media is encountered during processing of archival collections it is separated from folders and prepared for transfer by processing archivists.  

|When commercial software is present do not enter it in SPEC or label it. Send commercial software as is to Digital Preservation.|

Digital media separation procedures are detailed in this document. The workflows may vary based on media types  encountered but the general steps are as follows:  

* Remove digital carriers from folders and boxes.  
* Create a SPEC object record for each carrier.  
* Label digital carriers.  
* Fill out Digital Carrier Separation sheets.  
* Place Digital Carrier Separation sheets where carriers where found.  
* House digital carriers.  
* Inform Digital Archives of digital carriers.  

## Remove digital carriers from folders.  
* House digital carriers in boxes separate from other material.  

## Create a SPEC object record for each carrier.  
* Create an object record in SPEC for each carrier according to Collection Management practices.  
* Note the acquisition number and the SPEC object ID number.  
* ACQ_acqID_specObjectID ```ACQ_12345_54321``` is the carrier id used by Digital Preservation.  

In the image of a SPEC object record below the SPEC object ID is circled in top left and acq ID is circled in bottom right.

|Label transcript is an optional field. If you want to transcript a label you can enter text as it appears on the label. You can enter ```[illegible]``` for words you can't decipher.|  

## Label carriers.

* For floppy and zip disks, print the label with ACQ_acqID_specObjectID and affixed it to the media.

* For Optical media (CDs, DVDs), print the label with ACQ_acqID_specObjectID.  
* House CDs or DVDs in a sleeve or case if they are not housed.  
* Rehouse CDs or DVDs that are cased together, unless the case is designed for multiple discs.  
* Affix the label to the sleeve or case.  

|**Make sure no label adhesive sticks to moving parts of the media.**  
Many media types have shutters, gates, or spools that need to move freely to work. Covering a shutter or other moving part with a label can damage the disk and the drive used to read media.|  

* Check in with Digital Preservation staff to discuss labeling other media types.  

|Digital Preservation staff can label commercial software with a simple collection name.
```Crouch``` for Stanley Crouch papers.|

## 5. Fill out a digital carrier separation form.  

| Processing archivists can skip this step because processing archivists remove separation sheets when arrangement is finished before shipping.|  

* Fill out a
[digital carrier separation form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZWZ2xMUMPPMV1f0V6CesB-qz1IK5u765Wmr_0ESiZ6U/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} to document where in the collection a media object came from. 

* Enter the object's acquisition id number and collection id.  
* Enter the object's SPEC object id.    
  * Media IDs follow the naming convention ACQ_acqID_specObjectID.  
* Circle the format on the form.  
* Enter the correct format after the word Other if the format is not listed.  
* See [Identifying Digital Media](../sitevisits/identifying-digital-media) for media format types.

## 6. Shelve the media.

* Place completed boxes on shelf 02 in 205. The shelf is closest to 205A.  
* Email [digitalarchives@nypl.org](mailto:digitalarchives@nypl.org) and confirm boxes are shelved.
