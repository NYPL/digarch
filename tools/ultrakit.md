The Tableau Ultrakit is a case of portable forensic bridges, power supply, and cables. The kit contains IDE, SCSI, SATA, USB, and card forensic bridges. A firewire device forensic bridge was purchased separately but uses the same instructions as the Ultrakit. The Ultrakit can be used during site visits or in the lab. Currently, the Ultrakit forensic bridges are most commonly used with a Mac to transfer Apple formatted devices that are not recognized by the FREDs.
