Tableau Ultrabays are installed on each FRED. These Forensic bridges are used in the lab to prevent writing to collection devices. Ports on the Ultrabay are labeled. These include: SATA/SAS, Drive Power, PCIe, IDE, FireWire, and USB. Cables are available for most devices in the plastic drawers on the bakers rack.  A drive tray slides out below the Ultrabay panel to hold devices while connected.
