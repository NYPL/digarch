## Objectives
This document is divided into sub-pages with linked headings. Overall, this document describes
* Workflow steps
* When to contact Digital Archives staff
* Minimum requirements for electronic records survey
* Symbols used in FTK
* How to apply, remove, and create filters
* How to create bookmarks

## [Overview](Overview){:target="_blank"}
This page describes the basic steps for working with Electronic records that Archival Processing and Digital Archives will work on together.

## [Navigating Forensic Toolkit](Navigating-FTK){:target="_blank"}
This page describes tabs, windows, icons, labels and searches in FTK. This page also includes instructions for what to do when you encounter particular icons or types of material.


## Filters
Filters refine the File List to only display files within certain defined parameters. The result is similar to search filters but you only have to define the filters not a search. FTK comes with many default filters you can apply to the File List. Digital Archives staff have also created some filters to hide system files.

### Tips
* Bookmark with filters on
* Don’t include the Actual Files filter if you want to bookmarks files in Zip container
