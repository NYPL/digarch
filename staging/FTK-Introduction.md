# Working with Electronic records

## Objectives
This page describes
* Workflow steps
* When to contact Digital Archives staff
* Minimum requirements for electronic records survey
* Symbols used in FTK
* How to apply, remove, and create filters
* How to create bookmarks

## Overview
These are the basic steps for working with Electronic records that Archival Processing and Digital Archives will work on together.
* You are assigned a collection with Electronic records.
* Survey Electronic records and include them in the project proposal.
* Confirm whether you will use FTK to process the collection.
* Sign up to use a FRED workstation on the Digital Archives Lab Calendar.
* Label files.
* Bookmark files.
* Bookmark review by Digital Archives staff.
* ArchivesSpace import by Digital Archives and Manager, Archival Metadata.

## Communicating with Digital Archives staff
Send email to digitalarchives@nypl.org when
* You are assigned a collection with Electronic records.
    * Be clear about where you are in processing when you contact Digital Archives.
* You have completed your processing proposal.
* You find digital media in a collection.
* You sign up for time on the Digital Archives Lab calendar. 
    * At least 24 hours in advance
* You are ready to begin bookmarking.
* You are done bookmarking.
* You have completed any revisions suggested by Digital Archives staff.  

## Beginning Work with Electronic records
### Collection Assigned
* Review the collection for Electronic records.
* Send an email to digitalarchives@nypl.org and let us know the project timeframe.

### Survey
* Include electronic records in your initial survey for the project proposal.
* Read media labels to get an idea of the contents, at minimum.
* View hard drive contents with a write-blocker if files aren’t transferred.
* You may have the option to conduct the initial survey in FTK if files are transferred.
* Use labels instead of bookmarks in the initial survey.

## Preparing to Process

* [Reserve your FTK session](../using/using-lab-equipment#reserving-a-workstation-session) at least 24 hours in advance.
* Click the FTK icon to open FTK and begin your session. 
* Select your collection from the bar on the left hand side of the screen.  
**Information in the media log can assist with processing.**
* Open CMS and navigate to the collection's media log when appropriate.  

### Appraisal
Spend some time evaluating the electronic records before you begin bookmarking. You'll be using the same strategies you use for paper records for the most part but FTK has appraisal tools you should use as well.

### Icons
Icons representing files indicate the type of file you are viewing.
* Folders  
  ![a computer icon of a yellow file folder](FTK-Introduction/media/ftkfolders.png)
* Slack Space  
  ![computer icon of a white piece of paper with a yellow border on the bottom and red arrow pointing left](FTK-Introduction/media/ftkslackspace.png)
* Deleted Files  
  ![computer icon of a white piece of paper with a red X over it](FTK-Introduction/media/ftkdeleted.png)
* File systems  
  ![ a computer icon of a file hierarchy tree with lines between squares representing files](FTK-Introduction/media/ftkfilesystem.png)
* Unknown formats  
  ![a computer icon of a white piece of paper with a blue question mark over it](FTK-Introduction/media/ftkuknown.png)

### Icons to Watch Out for
In the normal course of events you shouldn’t see the following formats when you view files in FTK. Digital Archives staff apply profiles to FTK to keep from displaying Slack Space and Deleted files. If you see them please let us know before you proceed. We either need to review our work or identify the problem with the transfer. Unrecognized files systems and home video DVDs should be removed from FTK before you view files. DVDs are treated as AMI and not arranged as electronic records. Unrecognized file systems are most likely bad disks but might be in a format that requires emulation.

![a red octagonal stop sign](FTK-Introduction/media/stopsign.png)


#### Stop and discuss with Digital Archives staff if you see…

* Slack Space  
  ![computer icon of a white piece of paper with a yellow border on the bottom and red arrow pointing left](FTK-Introduction/media/ftkslackspace.png)
* Deleted Files  
  ![computer icon of a white piece of paper with a red X over it](FTK-Introduction/media/ftkdeleted.png)
* Unrecognized file systems  
  ![a computer icon of a file hierarchy tree with lines between squares representing files followed by the word unrecognized](FTK-Introduction/media/unrecognized%20FTK.PNG)
* DVDs
    * VIDEO_TS
* Seeing the above formats means something has gone awry
### Unviewable Formats
You should also stop and talk to us before proceeding if you see unviewable files that you think are in scope. There are many files that FTK designates as unknown. For many of these files you are still able to view the complete contents of the file in natural or filtered view. Those files can be arranged as usual. If you encounter files where you cannot see the complete contents in any view but think the files are in scope please discuss these files with digital archives staff. In the case of image files with no view in FTK like Canon RAW we can stage these images so you can view them with software outside of FTK. Another common example is Quark files. You can sometimes see limited text for Quark files in filtered view but you can’t view any images. Since we can only partially review these files we need to be aware of them if they are being arranged in packages for access.

#### Stop and discuss with Digital Archives staff if you see…
* Unknown formats with no Natural view and a limited Filtered view that are in scope  
  ![a computer icon of a white piece of paper with a blue question mark over it](FTK-Introduction/media/ftkuknown.png)
* Files that you would like to view outside of FTK  
* Files that you cannot completely review  
  ## Out of Scope Formats
There are some file types that either can’t be exported from FTK or don’t provide useful information. These file types should not be bookmarked. Sometimes the presence of many temp or system files can be confusing for researchers, making it difficult to find files with content among the many temp files. Unless you have received specific instructions from Digital Archives staff to the contrary, don’t bookmark folders, Slack Space, deleted files, file systems, .DS_Stores, Resource Forks, Alternate Data Streams, temp files, desktop DB or Icons.
### Don't Bookmark
* Folders  
  ![a computer icon of a yellow file folder](FTK-Introduction/media/ftkfolders.png)
* Slack Space  
  ![computer icon of a white piece of paper with a yellow border on the bottom and red arrow pointing left](FTK-Introduction/media/ftkslackspace.png)
* Deleted Files  
  ![computer icon of a white piece of paper with a red X over it](FTK-Introduction/media/ftkdeleted.png)
* File systems  
  ![ a computer icon of a file hierarchy tree with lines between squares representing files](FTK-Introduction/media/ftkfilesystem.png)
* .DS_STORE
* Resource Forks  
  ![ a computer icon of a white piece of paper with a blue question mark over it and the letters rsrc to the right of the paper](FTK-Introduction/media/resourceforkftk.png)
* Alternate Data Streams  
  ![ text 'Alternate Data Stream' as it appears in FTK](FTK-Introduction/media/altdatastream.png)
* temp files (~ or . in front)
* desktop DB
* Icon

## Filters
Filters refine the File List to only display files within certain defined parameters. The result is similar to search filters but you only have to define the filters not a search. FTK comes with many default filters you can apply to the File List. Digital Archives staff have also created some filters to hide system files.

### Using Filters
This section describes how to
* Use filters to hide file types you shouldn’t bookmark
* Toggle filters to see what’s hidden
* Create compound filters
* View filter definitions
* Import filters

### Tips
* Bookmark with filters on
* Don’t include the Actual Files filter if you want to bookmarks files in Zip container

### Importing a filter
This video demonstrates how to import a filter from the FTKsettings folder on the FREDs.

### Compound Filters
This video shows how to use compound filters in FTK. compound filters are an option when available saved filters don't work and you don't want to create definitions from scratch. It displays the difference between applying different operations to the Include and Exclude box. It demonstrates how the File List looks when filters are active and how to toggle filters on and off.

### Bookmark contents
When you have finished bookmarking, bookmarks should usually contain one level of files and no folders within it. Each bookmark with files in it should be a numbered ER. Series and Collection level bookmarks should not contain files.

* Numbered ERs should contain 1 level of files only and no folders
![Bookmarks tab with files displayed in File List](FTK-Introduction/media/filesadded.png)

### Exceptions
Here are exceptions to the guidelines above. 

#### Disk Images
Although I have said that file systems should not be bookmarked, We may ask you to bookmark file systems if we need to create disk image packages for access. We should check-in and have a conversation about arrangement before you create bookmarks to represent DI packages.

* Do bookmark file systems if digital archives staff say to create DI packages

#### Folders
It’s also possible that we will encounter cases where folder structure needs to be retained for access in specific software. This is also a case where we will need to have a conversation before you create bookmarks with folders. Digital Archives staff will need to know the folder structure you need. Creating the right folder structure requires manipulating options in FTK. The correct folder structure may not be possible to achieve with FTK in many cases. Ideally, when a specific folder structure is needed it will be created from a transfer outside of FTK. This is much easier. When you find you need to retain recursive folders this work should usually done at an archivist workstation.

* Retaining a folder structure to view files in specific software 
  * (AV projects, website backends)
* Discuss folder structure with Digital Archives staff 
* Make sure DA staff are aware folders will be retained before export
* Retaining folder structure across a collection
  * Arrange files at archivist workstation if you need recursive folders
  * More that 1 ER folder containing files per ER

#### Folder Export options
The options available for folder export in FTk to export the entire path down to the media container (data folder of MediaID) or retaining a bookmarked folder. Even if a folder within the bookmarked folder isn’t bookmarked it will be exported along with the bookmarked folder.

* Original path
  * All folders including data or MediaID
* Bookmarked folder and all folders within

#### Options for arrangements with folders
When you want to retain folders in your arrangement you have 3 options. This arrangement is easiest outside of FTK so even if the collection is loaded in FTK you may want to discuss this option with Digital Archives staff. 
You can arrange the contents of each folder as a separate ER. This is the easiest to do in FTK because it conforms to FTK’s defaults.
You can discuss exporting folders in FTK with Digital Archives staff. Remember you can only choose to retain an entire file path from the MediaID or you can choose to retain a folder and everything in it. You can’t exclude any content from folders with these options.

* Arrange folders outside of FTK
* Arrange the contents of each folder as an ER (ER 1, ER 2)
* Discuss exporting folders in FTK with Digital Archives staff
