* Archivists processing electronic records without using FTK or ePADD will receive an external hard drive or thumb drive with copies of files to be arranged.  

* Attach the drive to your workstation.  

* Open CMS and navigate
to the collection's media log.  

**Information in the media log will assist with processing. You will need to update fields at various points during processing.**

## Arranging and Describing Archives from a Workstation

The goal of the arrangement and description phase is to approximate the
process in which an archivist works with a physical collection. By using
their workstation the archivist will be able to appraise records as they are contained
on their original media, create a set of intellectual components
(arrangement), summarize the logical extents (size) and date ranges of
the components, and enter them into CMS and ArchivesSpace.

### Navigating the Drive

* Double-click the drive icon to display the drive folders in Windows Explorer.
* The folders will have the following structure:  
    * /M12345_workingfiles
		* /M12345-0001
			* /metadata
			* /objects 
        
* The metadata folder may contain metadata created during the transfer of the files. The .csv provides a file directory listing of the files which will provide additional information regarding the files (similar to the path view in FTK). You can open a .csv file in Microsoft Excel.

* The objects folder contains the files to be arranged. A Bagit transfer will contain a data folder within the objects folder. In this case, the data folder contains the files to be arranged.

### Processing  

* Appraise the files.  
* Ascertain the arrangement of the files.  
* Use information like file naming conventions, how the files relate to each other, and whether there are possible duplicates.  
* You can sort the .csv file by size, checksum, date, file , or path.  

### Arrangement  
* Create a new folder named /M12345_FAcomponents on the drive you received at the same folder level as /M12345_workingfiles when you are ready to arrange files.  
	* Within this folder create a folder for each FA Component using the following naming convention M12345_ER_1, M12345_ER_2.  
	* Create an objects folder within each ER_# folder.  
	* Move the files into the new FA Component objects folders as your process the files.  

* Calculate the size of each FA Component by right clicking on the FA Component folder and selecting Properties from the drop down menu.  
* Note the file count and byte extent, when you are done processing.
