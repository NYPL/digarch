Archivists processing electronic records without using FTK or ePADD will receive an external hard drive or thumb drive with copies of files to be arranged.  

## Using an External Hard Drive

* Attach the external hard drive or thumb drive to your workstation.  

* Open CMS and navigate
to the collection's media log.  

**Information in the media log will assist with processing. You will need to update fields at various points during processing.**

## Arranging and Describing Files from a Workstation

The goal of the arrangement and description phase is to approximate the
process in which an archivist works with a physical collection. By using
their workstation the archivist will be able to appraise records as they are contained
on their original media, create a set of intellectual components
(arrangement), summarize the logical extents (size) and date ranges of
the components, and enter them into CMS and ArchivesSpace.

### Navigating the Drive

* Double-click the drive icon to display the drive folders in Windows Explorer.
* The folders will have the following structure:  
    * \M12345_workingfiles
		* \M12345-0001
			* \metadata
			* \objects 
        
* Note the metadata folder may contain metadata created during the transfer of the files.  
* Note a file directory listing of the files in .csv format, if present.
* Open a .csv file in Microsoft Excel.  
* Navigate to the objects folder to view the files to be arranged.  
* Navigate to the data folder in the objects folder to view the files to be arranged in a Bagit transfer.  
* Note manifest.txt files contain a directory listing.  

### Processing  

* Appraise the files.  
* Ascertain the arrangement of the files.  
* Note file naming conventions, how the files relate to each other, and  possible duplicates.  
* Sort the .csv file by size, checksum, date, file , or path.  

### Arrangement  
* Create a new folder on the drive you received at the same folder level as \M12345_workingfiles.  
* Use the naming convention ```CollectionID_FAcomponents``` to create a collection folder.  
* Name the folder /M12345_FAcomponents, for example.  
* Create a folder for each FA Component using ```CollectionID_ER_1```, ```CollectionID_ER_2```.  
* Create an objects folder within each ER_# folder. ```CollectionID_ER_1\objects```
* Move the files into the new FA Component objects folders as your process the files.
* Calculate the size of each FA Component by right clicking on the FA Component folder.
* Select Properties from the drop down menu.  
* Note the file count and byte extent, when you are done processing.
