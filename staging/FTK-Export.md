# Exporting Finding Aid Components From FTK

{: .no_toc }
&nbsp;
{: .no_toc .text*delta }
When a finding aid has been approved and the Bookmarks have been reviewed the contents of Bookmarks need to be exported to Digital Archives storage.  
## Create Finding Aid Component Folders  
* Open the case for the collection and navigate to the Bookmark
tab.  
* Note how many finding aid components you have in the Bookmarks.  
* Open the WSL terminal  and navigate to the mount point directory by entering ```cd /mnt```

* Any mounted drives should be accessible from the mount point directory. Drives you'll see in /mnt include:
  * d - Sata Drive Bay
  * f - Storage for FTK
  * h - Open FTK cases
  * i - Codemeter access key
  * y - DigArchDiskStation

* If the Y:\ drive is not visible in /mnt or /mnt/y appears to be empty then re-mount:
  * Change to the top level directory by entering ```cd /```
  * Enter the command ```sudo mount -t drvfs Y: /mnt/y```  

```$ cd /mnt/y/Staging/faComponents```

```$ mkdir -p CollectionID/CollectionID_ER_{first..last}/{metadata/submissionDocumentation,objects}```  
* Change first to the number to begin making folders on and last should be
the number to end on.
