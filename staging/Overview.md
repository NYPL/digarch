# Beginning Work with Electronic records
## Collection Assigned
* Review the collection for Electronic records.
* Send an email to digitalarchives@nypl.org and let us know the project timeframe.

## Survey
* Include electronic records in your initial survey for the project proposal.
* Read media labels to get an idea of the contents, at minimum.
* View hard drive contents with a write-blocker if files arenâ€™t transferred.
* You may have the option to conduct the initial survey in FTK if files are transferred.
* Use labels instead of bookmarks in the initial survey.
* Labels are a tagging feature in FTK that assign a name and a color to a file or a range of files. 
* You can view label names in the File List. 

# Preparing to Process

* [Reserve your FTK session](../using/using-lab-equipment#reserving-a-workstation-session) at least 24 hours in advance.
* Click the FTK icon to open FTK and begin your session. 
* Select your collection from the bar on the left hand side of the screen.  
**Information in the media log can assist with processing.**
* Open CMS and navigate to the collection's media log when appropriate.  

## Appraisal
Spend some time evaluating the electronic records before you begin bookmarking. You'll be using the same strategies you use for paper records for the most part but FTK has appraisal tools you should use as well.
