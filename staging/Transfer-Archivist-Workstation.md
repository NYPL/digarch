Archivists processing electronic records without using FTK or ePADD will receive an external hard drive or thumb drive with copies of files to be arranged.  

## Retrieving the External Hard Drive
* Contact the processing archivist when they have finished processing a collection.
* Arrange to pick up the external hard drive.
* Transfer the files when the collection finding aid has been approved.

## Transferring a Finished Collection on the External Hard Drive

* Attach the drive to your workstation.  
*  Copy ```CollectionID_FAcomponents``` to ```DigArchDiskstation/Staging/faComponents```.
* Rename the collection folder on DigArchDiskstation by removing _FAcomponents.
```CollectionID_FAcomponents``` to ```CollectionID```

## Reusing the External Hard Drive
* Delete the contents of the external hard drive after the contents are transferred.
