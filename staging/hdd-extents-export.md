When Processing Archivists have completed processing a collection at the their workstations and have returned a hard drive with completed finding aid components to Digital Archives, Digital Archives staff prepare extents for import to ArchivesSpace using the report_hdd_extents script. This page describes instructions for preparing and exporting extents JSON files from a hard drive. See the [report_hdd_extents section of our Software documentation page]() for installation instructions.

## Review Finding Aid Components

## Run report_hdd_extents.py

## Deliver extents JSON to Archival Processing Unit

Digital archives staff should deliver the extents JSON file to the Processing Archvist(s) for the associated collection. The Manager of Archival Metadata should be included in any correspondence for assistance with and troubleshooting for JSON import into ArchivesSpace.
