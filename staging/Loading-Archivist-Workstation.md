Archivists processing electronic records without using FTK or ePADD will receive an external hard drive or thumb drive with copies of files to be arranged.  

## Confirming Archivist Workstation Processing 

* Open CMS and navigate to the collection's media log.  
* Check that all the media in the collection has been transferred as files.  
* Consult with Digital Archives staff if there are disk images present or transfer is incomplete.

## Preparing the External Hard Drive

* Attach the external hard drive or thumb drive to your workstation.  
* Delete any contents on the external hard drive.  

## Loading the External Hard Drive
* Navigate to fileTransfers.  
```DigArchDiskstation/Staging/ingest/fileTransfers```
* Copy the collection folder to the external hard drive.
```DigArchDiskstation/Staging/ingest/fileTransfers/M12345```
* Rename the collection folder on the external hard drive by appending _workingfiles.  
```M12345_workingfiles```
## Delivering the External Hard Drive
* Contact the processing archivist to let them know the external hard drive is ready.
* Arrange to drop off the external hard drive at the processing archivist's desk.
