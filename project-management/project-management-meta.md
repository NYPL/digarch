## Introduction:
Digital Archives carries several responsibilities at NYPL. Primary responsibilities include all actions needed to facilitate the management of born-digital portions of archival acquisitions across 11 curatorial units, working in collaboration with Collections Management, Curators, and Processing Archivists moving born-digital material through accession, inventory, transfer, survey and processing. Along with primary responsibilities, situational needs occur that require the development of new workflows or tools. This page describes the overarching approach to and philosophy of Project Management in NYPL Digital Archives. For information on born-digital collection material tracking see ..... or visit the concurrent Project Management pages in the associated workflow sections.

## Defining a Project: 
Digital Archives defines a project as any task or set of tasks falling outside of the bounds of daily responsiblities, requiring a specialized organizing of time and resources to meet a need.
