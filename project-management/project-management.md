## Introduction
Digital Preservation uses the Trello [Project Queue](https://trello.com/b/OjH0w4HO/digarch-project-queue){:target="_blank"} to track collections' progress through our workflows. Digital Preservation may also contribute to Archives Unit [Processing ](https://trello.com/b/qt21W2Xw/processing){:target="_blank"} Trello board when electronic records are found in a collection.  

## Begin Tracking a Collection
Any Digital Preservation Staff may perform this process.

* Receive an email to digitalarchives@nypl.org stating that electronic records exist in the collection. 
* Retrieve media from 202 with the media cart and place it on the incoming shelf in 205.
* Create or add to the collection Trello card. 
    * Use the New template for collections with multiple pieces of media. 
    * Use the Single template if there is only one piece of media.
* Add the shelf number label or custom field to the collection card based on the location of the media.   
* Delete checklist items that don't apply to the collection.  
    * Delete Create item records... checklist item when an archivist has created item records for the media before sending it to Digital Preservation.
* Add link to corresponding AU Trello card if it exists.
* Add the Electric Records label to the Archives Unit [Processing ](https://trello.com/b/qt21W2Xw/processing){:target="_blank"} Trello collection card if it is not yet added to the card. 
* Respond to the email that the media has been moved.

## Update CMS Project Management
Digital Preservation Manager performs this process

* Create or add to project in CMS.
* Leave project date blank.
* Add a duration, calculated as follows
```
Inventory: 1 day / 200 items
Transfer:
  1 day / 200 optical media
  1 day / 30 floppy disks
  1 day / 3 hard drive, usb stick, etc
  1 day / 5 obsolete media
Post-processing: 1 day / 200 GB
```

## Updating the Collection Card
Any Digital Preservation Staff may perform this process

* Move the collection card to the list that represents the current status of the checklist items.  
    * When working on the Inventory checklist items move the card to the Inventory list.  
    * Note, checking Export FTK reports item moves the card to Post-processing list automatically.  
    * Note, checking Transfer FA components... item moves the card to Storage list automatically.  
    *  Note, checking Add 2 year retention date... item moves the card to Storage list automatically.  
* Add yourself to a collection card for a collection you are working on.  
* Add a checklist item for each type and number of media in the Transfer checklist when more than one staff member is working on transferring a collection.  
    - [ ] 10 optical discs  
    - [ ] 1 hard drive  
* Contact archivist to advise on transfer as needed.
* Add a comment to the AU Trello card recommending FTK or workstation processing once all media has been transferred and digital preservation staff have reviewed the material.  
* Add comments to describe deaccessions or transfer issues.  
* Add a 2 year due date to the Retain FTK Case custom field once archivist description is complete.  

## Checking collection status
* Type the collection number `M29915` to search for a collection in Trello.  
    * Make sure to start with M. Leaving M out will result in a less useful search.  
* Check the results to make sure the card is on the board you want to use.  
* Use âŒ˜+F on a Mac or Ctrl+F on Windows to search within a Trello board.
