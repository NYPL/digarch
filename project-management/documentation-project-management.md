## Meetings
The Documentation project holds weekly meeting up to an hour long. Meetings divide upcoming work into quarterly themes or epics. Epics are related work that move toward an overall goal for the quarter. At the first meeting of a quarter, staff decide on 3 or 4 epics for the quarter. During the quarter, staff propose and self-assign tasks within an epic that can be completed in 1 or 2 weeks. 

Each week staff present significant updates to their work for others to review. When a task has been completed and reviewed during a meeting any associated Pull Requests can be merged. 

## Trello
Each epic is represented as a list on [Documentation Projects](https://trello.com/b/va8CctGX/documentation-projects){:target="_blank"} Trello board. Tasks are represented by cards. Cards can have a Github Pages site label, a due date, a status field, assigned members, and Github Pull Request attachments.
