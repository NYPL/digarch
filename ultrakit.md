# Introduction  
The Tableau Ultrakit is a case of portable forensic bridges, power supply, and cables. The kit contains IDE, SCSI, SATA, USB, and card forensic bridges. A firewire device forensic bridge was purchased separately but uses the same instructions as the Ultrakit. The Ultrakit can be used during site visits or in the lab. Currently, the Ultrakit forensic bridges are most commonly used with a Mac to transfer Apple formatted devices that are not recognized by the FREDs.    

## Connect cables.  
* Connect the power supply to the forensic bridge.
* Device cables are available in the yellow case or labeled plastic drawers on the bakers rack. 
* Connect devices with external power as usual.  
* Connect uncased internal devices to power through the forensic bridge with a 3M drive power cable or a Molex to 3M drive power cable.  

### IDE
* Connect the blue Host side of an IDE cable to the forensic bridge. Connect the black side to the device.  

## Set internal hard drives to single or master.  
* Make sure the jumper pins on the hard drive are set to single or master.  
    * Look for a schematic displaying where to place a shunt on the pins or etched labels on the circuit board.  
    * Research the hard drive model number if you can't find the jumper configuration on the drive.  

## Power on.  
* Switch on power on the forensic bridge. Switch on the device with transfer media.  
* Look for Power, Write Block, Host, Device, and, Activity lights to turn on.  
* Turn the device off and on again if the Activity light does not turn on after a minute. Turn the forensic bridge off and on if not resolved.  
    * Zip disk drives almost always need to be turned off and on before they will connect. This may also be necessary between Zip disks.  

## Check device connection.
* Look for the device under Disk Utility if you don't see a prompt indicating the device has been connected.   

## Completing a transfer.
* Contact the Digital Archives Assistant if transfer fails.   
* Turn the device and the forensic bridge off once the media has been transferred.  
* Disconnect the cables and place them back in the case or the labeled drawers.  
* Place the forensic bridge back in the case.  
* Place the media on the Transferred shelf.
