## Digital Image Requests

Curators may request images from a born-digital collection processed by Digital Archives staff. This page describes the workflow in a Digital Image request; how to request an image, and how Digital Archives staff find, prepare, share, track and complete image requests.  Please [contact NYPL Digital Archives](mailto:digitalarchives@nypl.org) with any questions.

### Request is made through Service Now:
* A curator makes a request for images by creating a Service Now ticket. 
  * The request is received by Assistant Director of Digital Preservation. 
  * Service Now ticket includes the associated name, the class-mark for the collection, and any descriptive information (ex. title of a performance) that may assist Digital Archives staff in identifying the requested images. 

### Request is added to Request Tracker:
* Assistant Director of Digital Preservation adds request as a Trello card to **Received List** on the [Digital Item Requests Tracker](https://trello.com/b/BvWkrdpE/digital-item-requests). 
  * Trello card is named using Collection Title and Service Now Ticket number. 

* Assistant Director of Digital Preservation notifies and assigns Digital Archives staff new request. Once assigned request Trello card is moved to **Assigned** list on [Digital Item Requests Tracker](https://trello.com/b/BvWkrdpE/digital-item-requests). 

### Associated media object for image content is identified:
* Digital Archives staff use collection name, class-mark, description and any other information provided by Requester to identify which media object or range of media objects from a collection may include requested images. 
  
* Image files may be located at any stage of Digital Archives processing. 
  
* Once images are located, copy image files into a folder. The folder name should be the service now ticket number. 

### Uploading requested images to Google Drive:
* Once requested images have been colelcted in the folder they are uploaded to a Collection Share google drive folder named for the associated curatorial division of the requester, by Digital Archives staff. Request packages are uploaded to Collection Share folders using rclone .
