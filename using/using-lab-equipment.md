Reserve your session to use a FRED or the 205 iMac at least 24 hours in advance using the
[Digital Archives Lab Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19mbjYzaTM1aGVnZWduaGhmaGtiZzg0aGozb0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t){:target="_blank"} calendar.

To schedule a time

# Labeling
A P-touch labeler is available in 205 for inventorying media.
* The P-touch can be found on one of the tables to the right of 205 as you enter the room.
* Rechargeable batteries for the P-touch can be found on the right-most table.
* Labeler tape can be found in the cabinet closest to 205A on the right side of the cabinet.
    * When only 2 packages of tape are left please alert Digital Preservation staff.

<!-- Other equipment locations here or on their equipment pages? -->
# Portable Forensic Bridges
* The Ultrakit yellow Pelican case is on the rack between the 2 FREDs. The Ultrakit contains IDE, SCSI, SATA, USB, and card forensic bridges, power supply and cables. Additional cables can be found in the labeled drawers on the rack.  
* A firewire forensic bridge with power supply and cables can be found in a black travel bag on the table that is right-most as you enter 205. Be sure you find a micro usb cable in the bag. Additional cables can be found in the labeled drawers on the rack, if not.
<!-- Should we label cabinets and tables, is there a convention for this? -->
