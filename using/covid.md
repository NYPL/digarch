{: .no_toc }


## General Lab Protocols and Procedures

The Digital Archives portion of 205 is limited to 3 staff at any given time.

Access to the small offices is controlled by Alison Rhonemus (205A) and Nick Krabbenhoeft (205B). Unless permitted, other staff should not enter these spaces.

Masks must be worn at all times within the general lab area of 205. Masks are not  required within 205A and 205B if staff are by themselves in those rooms.

Gloves are not required when working with Digital Archives material. Staff must sanitize their hands after entering 205 and before working with any material.

All trash should be deposited in the trash can by the door at the end of the day.

## Collection Safety Procedures

Collections can only be worked on by a single staff member at a time. If collections must pass to another staff member, they must be quarantined for 72 hours to substantially decrease the risk of COVID transmission while not using gloves. As a result of the quarantine procedure, staff are not required to use gloves while working with materials.

## Equipment Safety Procedures

Before using any shared equipment, staff must disinfect their hands. After using shared equipment, staff must disinfect all high-touch surfaces with wipes. Disinfectant lotion and wipes are stationed by the FRED in the lab area.

Examples of shared equipment include, but are not limited to: FRED, P-Touches, Nimbie Autoloader, and the forensic imaging equipment.

An example cleaning procedure for the FRED
1. Ensure all programs are closed.
2.  Wipe down the mouse.
3.  Wipe down the keyboard. This may cause the start menu or other popups to open, but will not cause major issues.
4.  Wipe down the monitor. Do not scrub the monitor because it may damage the coating on the screen. Afterwards, wipe with a paper towel to remove any lint.
5.  Wipe down the surrounding desk surface.  

## Enforcement

Staff found to repeatedly violate above policies may be subject to disciplinary action.
