## Introduction
Trello is used by Digital Preservation to track collections' progress through our workflows. Digital Preservation owns a [Project Queue]() Trello board tracking the status of digital material by collection. Digital Preservation may also contribute to Archives Unit [Processing ]() Trello board when electronic records are found in a collection.  

## Begin Tracking a Collection
* Create a Trello card for a collection when [digitalarchives@nypl.org](mailto:digitalarchives@nypl.org) receives an email stating that electronic records exist in the collection.  
* Create the collection Trello card from a template in the Queued Trello list. Use the New template for collections with multiple pieces of media. Use the Single template if there is only one piece of media.  
* Name the card using the convention of the placeholder name on the template, Collection Name followed by the Collection Number in parentheses.  
* The Digital Preservation Manager will retrieve media from 202 and place it on the incoming shelf in 205.  
* Add the shelf number label to the collection card based on the location of the media.  
* Check off items on the collection card checklists when you complete the items.  
* Delete checklist items that don't apply to the collection.  
    * Delete Create item records... checklist item when an archivist has created item records for the media before sending it to Digital Preservation.  
* Add the Electric Records label to the Archives Unit [Processing ]() Trello collection card if it is not yet added to the card.  

## Updating the Collection Card
* Move the collection card to the list that represents the current status of the checklist items.  
    * When working on the Inventory checklist items move the card to the Inventory list.  
* Add a checklist item for each type and number of media in the Transfer checklist when more than one staff member is working on transferring a collection.  
    - [ ] 10 optical discs  
    - [ ] 1 hard drive  
* Add a comment to the collection card recommending FTK or workstation processing once all media has been transferred and digital preservation staff have reviewed the material.  
* Add comments to describe deaccessions or transfer issues.  
* Add a two year due date to the card once archivist description is complete.  


## Searching
* Type the collection number `M29915` to search for a collection in Trello.  
    * Make sure to start with M. Leaving M out will result in a less useful search.  
* Check the results to make sure the card is on the board you want to use.  
* Use âŒ˜+F on a Mac or Ctrl+F on Windows to search within a Trello board.
