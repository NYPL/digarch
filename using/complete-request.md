## Completing a Digital Item Request
This page describes steps for Digital Archives staff completing digital item requests once a request has been received. 

### Item Request is received and assigned:
* After [a curator creates and submits a service now ticket](making-request.html), the ticket is received by the Assistant Director of Digital Preservation. 
* The Assistant Dircetor adds request as a Trello card to **Received List** on the [Digital Item Requests Tracker](https://trello.com/b/BvWkrdpE/digital-item-requests). 
  * Trello card is named using Collection Title and Service Now Ticket number. 

* Digital Archives staff are then notified and assigned a request.      
  * Once assigned a request, move the request Trello card to **Assigned** list on [Digital Item Requests Tracker](https://trello.com/b/BvWkrdpE/digital-item-requests). 

### Associated media object for image content is identified:
* Digital Archives staff use collection name, class-mark, description and any other information provided by Requester to identify which media object or range of media objects from a collection may include requested images. 
  
* Image files may be located at any stage of Digital Archives processing.
