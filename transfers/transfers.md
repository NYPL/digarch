Media is transferred to provide mediated access to born-digital material in the lab. 

## File Transfers
The most common method of transfer uses a Bagit script via command line.  

## Disk Imaging
Disk images are created when they facilitate viewing and accessing born-digital material.  Some legacy file formats cannot be viewed in recent operating systems. Imaging this material allows it to be viewed in an emulator.  

## Vendor Transfers
When the lab does not have the proper drive to access a type of media the media may be sent to a vendor for transfer.  

## Network Transfers  
In some cases born-digital material may be transferred over a network. Accessioning procedures for these types of transfers are still in progress.
